## Platform Architecture

### Core Philosophy

Deploy operates on three fundamental principles:

1. **AI-Native Architecture**: Every component is designed from the ground up to leverage artificial intelligence
2. **Transparent Pricing**: 30% markup + 15% refundable buffer with clear cost breakdowns
3. **Enterprise Security**: Five-tier security framework from Light to Defense-Grade compliance

### Integrated Framework Methodology

Deploy uniquely combines three proven methodologies into a unified real-time approach:

#### DMAIC Process Integration (Real-Time AI Processing)
- **Define** (Instant): Project scope and customer requirements captured instantly using ii-researcher and CommonGround
- **Measure** (Real-time): Performance baselines established automatically with Analytics tools and ACHEEVY Grading Engine  
- **Analyze** (Seconds): Root cause analysis performed instantly using LLM models, ii-agent, and CoT-Lab
- **Improve** (Minutes): Solution implementation executed rapidly with Development and CI/CD tools
- **Control** (Continuous): Real-time process monitoring with Security tools and ACP Protocol

*The entire DMAIC process happens seamlessly in the background while users interact with the platform. There are no waiting periods - the AI processes everything in real-time as users describe their needs.*

#### FDH Strategic Framework
- **Foster**: Relationship building using Communication tools, CRM systems, and Perform Platform
- **Develop**: Solution creation with Development frameworks, AI Core tools, and Integration systems
- **Hone**: Performance optimization through Testing tools, Analytics, and continuous refinement
